We actually work this system. In the last presentation, delete functions doesn't work.
But, it works before presentation and fix the problems.
That problems is that we change some script during presentation class time :))

So, our system totally works now. But we know there are some problems yet.
This is our best in limited time. Please check it.

We did not show how to delete or update users or books.
But it is so easy.

Update : you can click the record and modify the value directly.
         After that, you can enter to confirm. Finaly, you can click update button. 
         For user, only name can be modified because email value is unique.
         For book, title, author and issue can be modified.
         
Delete : you can click the record and then click delete button.
         If the user borrow book, user cannot be deleted.

Thank your for reading our system tutorial.
